# Basic Concepts

## Core Concepts

### Tasks

A task is the basic unit of work in vTask. Tasks have:
- Unique ID
- Title and description
- Status (Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done)
- Priority (Low, Normal, High)
- Labels for categorization
- Dependencies and relationships

Tasks are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter, making them:
- Human-readable
- Version controllable
- Easy to edit
- Portable

### Boards

Boards organize tasks into columns representing workflow stages:
- **Backlog**: Planned work
- **In Progress**: Active tasks
- **Review**: Tasks needing review
- **Done**: Completed tasks

Features:
- Customizable columns
- WIP limits
- Filtering
- Statistics

### Documentation

Documentation in vTask is:
- Markdown-based
- Linked to tasks
- Version controlled
- AI-enhanced

Features:
- Task references using `[[task-id]]`
- Automatic link validation
- Rich formatting
- Search functionality

## AI Integration
