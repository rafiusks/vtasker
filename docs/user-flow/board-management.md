# Board Management Flow

## Overview
The board management system allows users to create, view, update, and delete boards. Each board serves as a container for tasks and includes settings for collaboration and organization.

## Flow Steps

   - User navigates to `/boards` page
   - System displays list of existing boards
   - "Create Board" button is visible

2. **Board Creation**
   - User clicks "Create Board" button
   - System displays create board modal
   - Required fields:
     - Board Name
   - Optional fields:
     - Board Description
   - Validation:
     - Board name cannot be empty
     - Board name must be unique
   - On successful creation:
     - Board is created
     - User is redirected to new board page
     - Success message is displayed
   - On validation error:

3. **Board Settings**
   - User clicks "Board Settings" button on board page
   - System displays settings modal
   - Available actions:

     - User is redirected to boards page
     - Success message is displayed
   - On cancellation:
     - Dialog closes
     - No changes are made

5. **Error Flows**

   a. **Validation Errors**
   - Empty board name: Shows validation message
   - Duplicate board name: Shows "board name already exists" error
   - User remains on form
   - Form retains valid values

   b. **Network Errors**
   - Shows appropriate error message
   - User remains on current page
   - Data is preserved

6. **Modal Behavior**

     - Clicking Cancel button
     - Clicking outside modal
     - Pressing Escape key
   - Form state is reset on modal close

## Test Coverage

The board management flow is covered by end-to-end tests in `e2e/board/board.spec.ts`:

1. ✓ Board creation with validation
   - Create board with valid data
   - Validate required fields
   - Handle duplicate board names
   - Test modal interactions

2. ✓ Board updates
   - Update board details
   - Validate changes
   - Handle validation errors

3. ✓ Board deletion
   - Delete board with confirmation
   - Verify board removal
   - Handle deletion errors

## Implementation Notes

- Board operations require authentication
- Board names must be unique per user
- Board slugs are auto-generated from names
- Success/error messages use toast notifications
- Modal state is managed through React context
- Navigation uses client-side routing
- Board data is cached for performance
- Real-time updates for collaborative features (TBD)
