# System Architecture

## Overview

vTasker is a modern task management system built with a microservices architecture. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and developer-friendly.

## Core Components

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is built with Next.js and TypeScript, providing a modern and type-safe development experience.

1. **State Management:**
   - **Local State:** React's useState and useReducer
   - **Global State:** Zustand for simple and efficient state management
   - **Server State:** TanStack Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization

2. **API Integration:**
   - Custom API client with automatic error handling
   - Type-safe query hooks for data fetching
   - Automatic request retries and error recovery
   - Token-based authentication

3. **UI Components:**
   - Modular component architecture
   - Shared UI component library
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Responsive design

### Backend (Go)

The backend is built with Go, providing high performance and strong type safety.

1. **HTTP Server:**
   - Chi router for HTTP routing
   - Middleware for logging, recovery, and CORS
   - Structured error handling
   - RESTful API endpoints with versioning (v1)

2. **Database Layer:**
   - PostgreSQL for persistent storage
   - Connection pooling
   - Transaction management
   - Query optimization
   - Soft delete support
   - Automatic timestamp management

3. **Caching Layer:**
   - Redis for caching
   - Session management
   - Rate limiting

4. **Project Module:**
   - Models with validation using validator/v10
   - Repository pattern for database operations
   - Service layer with business logic
   - HTTP handlers with proper error handling
   - Pagination support
   - Project statistics (issue counts)
   - Soft delete functionality

## Data Flow

1. **Request Flow:**
   ```
   Client -> Next.js -> API Client -> Go Backend -> Database/Cache
   ```

2. **Response Flow:**
   ```
   Database/Cache -> Go Backend -> API Client -> Next.js -> Client
   ```

3. **Project Operations Flow:**
   ```
   HTTP Request -> Handler -> Service -> Repository -> Database
         ↑            ↓         ↓           ↓           ↓
   HTTP Response <- JSON <- Validation <- Models <- SQL Query
   ```

3. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Client-side caching with TanStack Query
   - Server-side caching with Redis
   - Database query caching

## Security

1. **Authentication:**
   - Token-based authentication
   - Secure session management
   - HTTPS enforcement

2. **Authorization:**
   - Role-based access control
   - Resource-level permissions
   - API key authentication for external access

3. **Data Protection:**
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF protection

## Development Environment

1. **Local Development:**
   - Docker Compose for services
   - Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
   - Environment-based configuration

2. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests
   - Performance testing

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Application metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - Log aggregation

## Deployment

1. **Infrastructure:**
   - Containerized deployment
   - Load balancing
   - High availability
   - Automatic scaling

2. **CI/CD:**
   - Automated testing
   - Continuous integration
   - Continuous deployment
   - Environment promotion

3. **Backup and Recovery:**
   - Database backups
   - Disaster recovery
   - Data retention

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability:**
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Microservices decomposition
   - Cache optimization
   - Database sharding

2. **Features:**
   - AI integration
   - Real-time updates
   - Webhook system
   - Public API

3. **Performance:**
   - CDN integration
   - Edge computing
   - Performance optimization
   - Load testing
