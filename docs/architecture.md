# vTask Architecture

## Overview

vTask is built as a modern web application with a focus on performance, extensibility, and AI integration. This document outlines the key architectural decisions and components.

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend (Vite + React)

```
web/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── routes/         # Page components and routing
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── utils/         # Utility functions
└── styles/        # CSS and styling
```

Key technologies:
- Vite for build tooling
- React for UI components
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching

### 2. Task Management

```
.vtask/
├── tasks/         # Task markdown files
├── boards/        # Board configurations
└── templates/     # Task templates
```

Features:
- Markdown-based task storage
- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Git-based version control
- Real-time updates

### 3. AI Integration

The AI system is designed to:
- Analyze task descriptions
- Suggest task relationships
- Generate documentation
- Optimize board layouts

Components:
```
ai/
├── analyzers/     # Task analysis modules
├── generators/    # Content generation
├── optimizers/    # Board optimization
└── utils/         # AI utilities
```

## Data Flow

1. Task Creation:
   ```
   UI -> Task Form -> Validation -> File Creation -> Git Commit -> UI Update
   ```

2. Board Updates:
   ```
   Drag Event -> Optimistic UI Update -> API Call -> File Update -> WebSocket -> UI Sync
   ```

3. AI Analysis:
   ```
   Task Change -> AI Queue -> Analysis -> Suggestion Generation -> UI Notification
   ```

## Design Decisions

### 1. File-based Storage
- Uses markdown files for tasks
- Git for version control
- Easy backup and sync
- Human-readable format

### 2. Real-time Updates
- WebSocket for live updates
- Optimistic UI updates
- Conflict resolution

### 3. AI Integration
- Asynchronous processing
- Pluggable AI providers
- Cached suggestions
- Rate limiting

## Security

1. Authentication:
   - JWT-based auth
   - Role-based access
   - API key management

2. Data Protection:
   - Encrypted storage
   - Audit logging
   - Backup system

## Performance

1. Optimizations:
   - Static file caching
   - Incremental updates
   - Lazy loading

2. Monitoring:
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Usage analytics

## Future Considerations

1. Scalability:
   - Distributed task storage
   - Multi-user support
   - Team workspaces

2. Extensions:
   - Plugin system
   - Custom AI models
   - Integration APIs
