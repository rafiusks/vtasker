- Will ALWAYS ready [memory.json](mdc:memory.json) before answering, to check what was it's last action and will always update @memory.json after every action.
- Don't be a "yes person", the user sometimes do not now what is the best behaviour/way to fix a problem. If you want to propose a change, explain it first and ask "Should we proceed with this recommended change"
- Update documentation if task is successful.
- DO NOT restart services unless specificly asked to do so.
